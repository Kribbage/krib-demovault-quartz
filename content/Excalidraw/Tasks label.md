# Text Elements
Here are several examples of how I lay out
task queries in my own vault. 
As well as an example legend for emoji 
based tags for organizing tasks

some of these views might appear empty
as there are no tasks written out to
populate the lists, but clicking onto the 
edit box in the right corner of each callout
will show the queries used.  ^5T6FeRP8
