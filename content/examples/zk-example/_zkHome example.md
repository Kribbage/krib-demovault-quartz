>[!question] This vault
>Obsidian stores all of your notes as plain text files in a folder structure. Feel free to copy this vault into a new folder (name the folder something you will remember) and open that folder as a vault to experiment with. 
>Or you can make your own fresh vault with none of the customizations we have already covered that exist in this vault. All configuration changes are stored inside the hidden .obsidian/ directory in every vault and will not affect other vaults when you make a change.
>	All folders and .md files in copies of this vault besides the hidden .obsidian directory are safe to delete without worry of losing configuration or plugin changes.
