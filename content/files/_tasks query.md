we can add custom statuses as well (depends on chosen theme)

```tasks
```

We can also use tags to create different views that will visualize our tasks in multiple ways. By category, using tags - by due date/start date/ etc. - by progress status .   


>group by tags
```tasks
group by tags
sort by due
```

> and we can filter this way
> `(tags include #task/ðŸ§¹) OR (tags include #task/chore)`

```tasks
(tags include #task/ðŸ§¹) OR (tags include #task/chore)
```
